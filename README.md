After setting up, you can run the application using [foreman]:

    % foreman start

If you don't have `foreman`, see [Foreman's install instructions][foreman]. It
is [purposefully excluded from the project's `Gemfile`][exclude].

ActiveRecord and ActionMailer

* ActionMailer: d750823, a07d360

Reversing these commits should put you on the right track.
